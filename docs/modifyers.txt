Entropy Modifier


 """
    Calculate entropy of wrong answer distributions per position (internal function).

    HIGH entropy (uniform wrong answers) = GOOD (high signal-to-noise ratio)
    LOW entropy (concentrated wrong answers) = BAD (low signal-to-noise ratio)

    Args:
        logits: Model logits (batch_size, seq_len, vocab_size)
        targets: Target tokens (batch_size, seq_len)
        vocab_size: Size of vocabulary
        mask: Optional boolean mask (batch_size, seq_len) - only calculate for masked positions

    Returns:
        per_sample_entropies: (batch_size,) - entropy per sample (averaged over valid positions)
    """


Targets smoothing

    """
    Apply label smoothing to target tokens.
    
    Args:
        targets: Target token IDs (batch_size, seq_len)
        uncertainty_factor: Label smoothing factor (0.0 = no smoothing, >0 = apply smoothing)
        vocab_size: Size of vocabulary
        special_token_ids: List of special token IDs to exclude from smoothing (optional)
        device: Device to create tensors on
        
    Returns:
        smoothed_targets: Probability distribution targets (batch_size, seq_len, vocab_size)
    """


Weight loss by mask ratio
   """
    Apply loss multiplier inversly proportional to the square root of the mask ratio.
