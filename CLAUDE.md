Allways create list of tasks (possibly with subtasks, for big chunks of work) using task creation tools

Before implementing any changes create feature branch from current branch

Include automated tests in task list as frequently as possible
Allways read currrent task list before updating it

Keep task list up to date.

Never rush to next stage untill all tasks from previous stage are finished.

Never edit existing tests to make them passing without explicit permission

When explicitly asked to review some file or directory allways read full content of file or directory before proceeding.

You can still use codebase search and Augment Context tools, but you should use them on top of reading files, not instead of.

Do not create documentation (Markdown files) if you are not explicitly asked to.


Iffile editing tool call fails then before retrying allways read full content of the file you were trying to edit, and only knowing exact content of a filerun improvededit command

Under no circumstances write bullshit like "Magor success" when there are still failing tests

do commits frequently with meaningful messages

finish your work by pushing current feature branch to remote and create PR requesting merge to branch current branch has been created from (not necesarily master/main)
