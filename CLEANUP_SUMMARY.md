# Critic Refactor - Complete Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all changes made during the critic implementation refactor, including the removal of all unused code.

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
1. **model.py**
   - Added `CriticMode` enum (NONE, TARGETLESS, TARGETED)
   - Replaced `add_critic_head` boolean with `critic_mode` enum
   - Upgraded critic head from simple linear to MLP + Sigmoid
   - Completely rewrote `_forward_language_model` method
   - Removed import of `build_critic_artifacts_from_logits`
   - Removed dependency on `sample_utils`

2. **train.py**
   - Updated imports to include `CriticMode`
   - Replaced `add_critic_head` config with `critic_mode`
   - Removed `critic_target_scope`, `mask_token_id`, `pad_token_id` from config

3. **core/evaluator.py**
   - Removed import of `build_critic_artifacts_from_logits`
   - Updated to use `CriticMode` instead of `add_critic_head`
   - Simplified critic statistics collection
   - Changed from target-based metrics to confidence score metrics
   - Removed complex artifact building logic

4. **sample_utils.py**
   - **REMOVED**: `build_critic_artifacts_from_logits` function (60+ lines)
   - This function is no longer used anywhere in the codebase

### Sampling Scripts
5. **sample.py**
   - Updated all critic checks to use `critic_mode != CriticMode.NONE`
   - Added `CriticMode` import

6. **sample_simple.py**
   - Updated all critic checks to use `critic_mode != CriticMode.NONE`
   - Added `CriticMode` import
   - Updated docstring

### Configuration Files
7. **config/train_char_diffusion_critic_head.py**
   - Changed `add_critic_head=True` to `critic_mode='targetless'`

8. **config/train_char_diffusion_critic_a40.py**
   - Changed `add_critic_head=True` to `critic_mode='targetless'`

### Tests
9. **tests/test_critic_toggle.py**
   - Completely rewritten to test new CriticMode enum
   - Removed old toggle-based tests
   - Added tests for all three modes

10. **tests/test_critic_utils.py**
    - **REMOVED**: This file tested `build_critic_artifacts_from_logits`
    - No longer needed since the function was removed

### Documentation
11. **docs/critic_refactor_summary.md**
    - Created comprehensive refactor documentation

12. **verify_critic_modes.py**
    - Created verification script for testing all modes

## Code Removed

### Functions Completely Removed
- `build_critic_artifacts_from_logits` from `sample_utils.py` (~60 lines)
  - This function built complex artifacts for the old critic implementation
  - Required second forward pass through transformer
  - No longer needed with new simplified approach

### Configuration Parameters Removed
- `add_critic_head: bool` → replaced by `critic_mode: CriticMode`
- `critic_target_scope: str` → no longer needed
- `mask_token_id: int` → no longer needed for critic
- `pad_token_id: int` → no longer needed for critic

### Test Files Removed
- `tests/test_critic_utils.py` → tested removed function

## Lines of Code Impact

### Removed
- `sample_utils.py`: -60 lines (removed function)
- `model.py`: -70 lines (simplified forward logic)
- `core/evaluator.py`: -50 lines (simplified stats collection)
- `tests/test_critic_utils.py`: -94 lines (entire file removed)
- **Total removed: ~274 lines**

### Added
- `model.py`: +80 lines (new CriticMode logic, cleaner implementation)
- `docs/critic_refactor_summary.md`: +164 lines
- `verify_critic_modes.py`: +134 lines
- **Total added: ~378 lines**

### Net Change
- **Net: +104 lines** (but much cleaner, more maintainable code)

## Verification

All changes have been verified:
1. ✓ No diagnostics/errors in modified files
2. ✓ Verification script runs successfully
3. ✓ All three critic modes work correctly
4. ✓ No remaining references to removed code
5. ✓ No imports of removed functions

## Migration Path

For existing code using the old implementation:

### Old Code
```python
if getattr(model.config, 'add_critic_head', False):
    # critic is enabled
```

### New Code
```python
from model import CriticMode
if getattr(model.config, 'critic_mode', CriticMode.NONE) != CriticMode.NONE:
    # critic is enabled
```

### Old Config
```python
add_critic_head = True
critic_target_scope = 'masked_and_ignore'
mask_token_id = 63
pad_token_id = 0
```

### New Config
```python
critic_mode = 'targetless'  # or 'targeted' or 'none'
# That's it! Much simpler.
```

## Benefits Summary

1. **Simpler**: Removed 274 lines of complex logic
2. **Faster**: Single forward pass instead of two
3. **Cleaner**: No cross-module dependencies (model.py doesn't import sample_utils)
4. **More maintainable**: Clear separation of three modes
5. **Better architecture**: MLP critic head is more expressive
6. **Easier to understand**: Explicit modes instead of boolean flags and scope strings

## Commits

1. `94e4404` - Main refactor with all code changes
2. `464513f` - Documentation summary
3. `23990cb` - Verification script
4. `faaf302` - Remove unused code and update evaluator

## Branch Status

- Branch: `feature/critic-mode-refactor`
- Based on: `feature/critic-toggle-inference`
- Status: Ready for testing
- **NOT pushed to remote** (as requested)
