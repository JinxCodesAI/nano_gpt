Judge Model Usage Example

This script demonstrates how to use the judge model for wrongness_factor calculation
in your training configuration.

The judge model predicts masking ratios and scales per-sample losses based on
prediction accuracy using the formula:
wrongness_factor = predicted_masking_ratio / clamp(real_masking_ratio + 0.1, max=1)

# Example configuration for train_run2.py
EXAMPLE_CONFIG = """
# Judge model configuration (add to your config file)
judge_model_checkpoint = "out/ckpt_sequence_scorer_1000_best.pt"  # Path to your trained judge model
enable_judge_model = True

# The judge model should be a sequence_scoring model (ModelMode.SEQUENCE_SCORER)
# trained to predict masking ratios (0-1 range)

# Example training command:
# python train_run2.py --config=your_config.py --judge_model_checkpoint=out/judge_model.pt --enable_judge_model=True
"""

# Example of what happens during training
TRAINING_FLOW = """
Training Flow with Judge Model:

1. Forward pass: model(X, Y) -> logits, loss
2. Calculate per-sample losses from logits
3. Judge model workflow:
   a. Use existing logits to get reconstructed tokens (argmax)
   b. Create final sequences (original + reconstructed masked tokens)
   c. Add [CLS] token and pass through judge model
   d. Get predicted masking ratios (0-1)
4. Calculate real masking ratios from mask tensor
5. Compute wrongness_factor = predicted / clamp(real + 0.1, max=1)
6. Scale per-sample losses by wrongness_factor
7. Apply entropy penalty (if enabled)
8. Aggregate to final scalar loss

Debug output (every 100 iterations):
  Judge model - Predicted: 0.519Â±0.001, Real: 0.309Â±0.062, Wrongness: 1.327Â±0.194

# Performance characteristics
PERFORMANCE_INFO = """
Performance Characteristics:

âœ… GPU Optimized:
- Reuses existing logits (no redundant forward passes)
- Batch processing for all operations
- Memory efficient tensor operations

âœ… Timing (CPU, batch_size=16, block_size=512, vocab_size=1000):
- ~67ms per call
- Scales linearly with batch size
- GPU would be significantly faster

âœ… Memory Usage:
- No duplicate model storage
- Minimal temporary tensor allocation
- Efficient argmax and tensor operations

# Judge model requirements
JUDGE_MODEL_REQUIREMENTS = """
Judge Model Requirements:

1. Model Type: sequence_scoring (ModelMode.SEQUENCE_SCORER)
2. Architecture: Bidirectional attention with sequence_head
3. Input: Sequences with [CLS] token prepended
4. Output: Single continuous score 0-1 (sigmoid activation)
5. Training: Trained to predict actual masking ratios

Example judge model training:
- Use sequence_scoring training type
- Target: actual masking ratios from training data
- Loss: MSE loss for continuous prediction
- Architecture: Same as main model but with sequence_head
