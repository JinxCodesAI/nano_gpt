# Training Orchestrator Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the Dynamic Training Orchestrator for GPT model training, as specified in `docs/training_morfing_operations.md`.

## Overview

The Training Orchestrator enables dynamic adjustment of training hyperparameters during training based on validation loss thresholds and timeout conditions. This implementation focuses on the main scaffolding and basic operations.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Infrastructure
- **Dynamic State Parameters**: Multipliers and divisors for all configurable training parameters
- **Scaling Schedule**: YAML/JSON configuration loading for operation sequences
- **Main Training Loop Integration**: Automatic trigger checking and operation execution
- **Operation Execution Framework**: Master function handling all operation types

### ✅ Basic Operations
- `change_lr`: Multiply learning rate by specified factor
- `change_batch_size`: Multiply batch size by specified factor
- `change_grad_accum`: Multiply gradient accumulation steps by specified factor
- `reset_lr_schedule`: Reset learning rate warmup/decay schedule offset

### ✅ Training Schedule Operations
- `change_warmup_iters`: Multiply warmup iterations and lr_decay_iters by specified factor
- `change_eval_iters`: Multiply evaluation iterations by specified factor
- `change_eval_interval`: Multiply evaluation frequency by specified factor

### ✅ Testing & Validation
- Integration tests for configuration loading and validation
- Manual test simulation of orchestrator behavior
- Sample configuration files for different use cases

## Usage

### 1. Configuration

Create a scaling schedule configuration file (YAML or JSON):

```yaml
# configs/my_schedule.yaml
- name: change_lr
  value: 2.0              # Double the learning rate
  trigger_loss: 6.0       # Trigger when val loss < 6.0
  max_wait_iters: 50000   # Or after 50k iterations
  reevaluate: false       # Don't re-evaluate loss immediately

- name: change_batch_size
  value: 1.5              # Increase batch size by 50%
  trigger_loss: 5.5
  max_wait_iters: 75000
  reevaluate: false

- name: change_eval_interval
  value: 2.0              # Double evaluation interval (evaluate less frequently)
  trigger_loss: 5.0
  max_wait_iters: 100000
  reevaluate: false

- name: change_eval_iters
  value: 1.5              # Increase evaluation precision by 50%
  trigger_loss: 4.5
  max_wait_iters: 125000
  reevaluate: true

- name: change_warmup_iters
  value: 0.8              # Reduce warmup iterations by 20%
  trigger_loss: 4.0
  max_wait_iters: 150000
  reevaluate: false
```

### 2. Training Script Usage

Set the scaling schedule file in your training configuration:

```bash
python train.py --scaling_schedule_file=configs/my_schedule.yaml
```

Or modify the `scaling_schedule_file` parameter in `train.py` directly.

### 3. Monitoring

The orchestrator will log operation executions:

```
=== SCALING OPERATION TRIGGERED ===
Operation: change_lr
Trigger reason: Loss threshold
Current val loss: 5.8, Trigger loss: 6.0
Learning rate multiplier updated to: 2.0
=== SCALING OPERATION COMPLETE ===
```

## Configuration Files

### Sample Configurations
- `configs/sample_scaling_schedule.yaml`: Production example with realistic thresholds
- `configs/sample_scaling_schedule.json`: Same schedule in JSON format
- `configs/test_scaling_schedule.yaml`: Quick-trigger configuration for testing
- `configs/multiplier_operations_example.yaml`: Example using new multiplier operations

### Configuration Format

Each operation requires:
- `name`: Operation function name
- `value`: Parameter for the operation (multiplier, etc.)
- `trigger_loss`: Validation loss threshold to trigger operation
- `max_wait_iters`: Maximum iterations to wait before forcing operation
- `reevaluate`: Whether to immediately re-evaluate validation loss after operation

## Testing

### Run Integration Tests
```bash
python test_integration.py
```

### Run Manual Simulation
```bash
python test_manual.py
```

## Implementation Details

### Dynamic State Parameters
Located in `train.py` after the system configuration:
- `lr_multiplier`: Current learning rate multiplier
- `batch_size_multiplier`: Current batch size multiplier
- `grad_accum_multiplier`: Current gradient accumulation multiplier
- `lr_schedule_offset`: Offset for learning rate schedule reset
- `warmup_iters_multiplier`: Current warmup iterations multiplier
- `eval_iters_multiplier`: Current evaluation iterations multiplier
- `eval_interval_multiplier`: Current evaluation interval multiplier

### Operation Execution
The `execute_operation()` function handles all operations and updates global state. It includes validation for:
- Positive multiplier values
- Valid operation names
- Minimum values for batch size and gradient accumulation

### Trigger Logic
Operations are triggered when either:
1. **Loss Threshold**: `current_val_loss < trigger_loss`
2. **Timeout**: `(current_iter - iter_of_last_op) >= max_wait_iters`

## Future Extensions

This implementation provides the foundation for more advanced operations:
- Model architecture changes (layer stacking, MLP widening)
- LoRA rank adjustments
- Optimizer state preservation
- Masked Structural Growth (MSG)

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE**: Main scaffolding and basic operations implemented and tested
⏳ **PENDING**: Advanced architectural operations (Section 5 & 6 of specification)

The implementation is ready for manual testing and review before proceeding with complex model architecture operations.
