there is few issues, train script (correctly ) contains settings like 
  eval_iters = 20 that generation script knows nothing about but that is strictly needed to determine how many samples  
  to fetch. Also in original code validation set is loaded once and stays the same for whole training process so there  
  is no need for loading per iteration, How this should work: 1) data generation script prepares some fixed amount of   
  validation samples, amount is declared in config, 2) config also declares number of samples per file 3) from this     
  numbers train_run script determines how many samples and wfrom where it wants to read if he wants to repeat something 
  or not - this is training specific logic.

● You're absolutely right! I see several critical issues with the current validation batch construction:

  Current Issues

  1. Missing eval_iters context: The dataset preparation doesn't know how many validation samples the training script   
  needs
  2. Per-iteration loading: Current system loads validation batches per-iteration, but validation set should be fixed   
  for entire training
  3. Wrong abstraction level: Dataset preparation is making training-specific decisions about how many samples to       
  generate

  Correct Architecture

  1. Dataset Preparation (data-layer responsibility)

  # In data/shakespeare_char_diffusion/training_config.py
  VALIDATION_SAMPLES_PER_STAGE = 100  # Fixed number per validation stage
  SAMPLES_PER_FILE = 50               # How many samples in each .pt file

  # In prepare.py - generates fixed validation data
  def prepare_validation_data():
      for stage_idx, stage_config in enumerate(VALIDATION_STAGES):
          stage_samples = []
          for sample_idx in range(VALIDATION_SAMPLES_PER_STAGE):
              # Generate deterministic validation sample
              sample = generate_validation_sample(stage_config, sample_idx)
              stage_samples.append(sample)

          # Save in files of SAMPLES_PER_FILE size
          for file_idx in range(0, len(stage_samples), SAMPLES_PER_FILE):
              file_samples = stage_samples[file_idx:file_idx + SAMPLES_PER_FILE]
              torch.save(file_samples, f'validation/stage_{stage_idx}_file_{file_idx//SAMPLES_PER_FILE}.pt')

  2. Training Script (training-layer responsibility)

  # In train_run.py - decides how to sample from available validation data
  def load_validation_set(dataset_config, eval_iters):
      """Load fixed validation set ONCE at training start"""
      validation_batches = []

      # Training script decides how many samples it needs
      samples_needed_per_stage = eval_iters

      for stage_idx in range(len(dataset_config.training_config.VALIDATION_STAGES)):
          stage_samples = []
          samples_collected = 0
          file_idx = 0

          while samples_collected < samples_needed_per_stage:
              # Load validation file
              file_path = f"{dataset_config.data_dir}/validation/stage_{stage_idx}_file_{file_idx}.pt"
              file_samples = torch.load(file_path)

              # Take what we need
              remaining_needed = samples_needed_per_stage - samples_collected
              samples_to_take = min(len(file_samples), remaining_needed)
              stage_samples.extend(file_samples[:samples_to_take])

              samples_collected += samples_to_take
              file_idx += 1

          validation_batches.append(stage_samples)

      return validation_batches  # Fixed for entire training

  3. Validation Execution

  def estimate_loss(model, validation_batches, eval_iters):
      """Use pre-loaded fixed validation set"""
      for stage_idx, stage_samples in enumerate(validation_batches):
          for sample_idx in range(min(eval_iters, len(stage_samples))):
              X, Y, mask = stage_samples[sample_idx]
              # ... run validation

  Key Principles

  1. Data Layer: Provides "buffet" of validation samples, doesn't know training needs
  2. Training Layer: Decides how much to "eat from buffet" based on eval_iters
  3. Fixed Validation: Loaded once at training start, never changes
  4. Configurable: Both sample generation and consumption are configurable
  5. Efficient: No per-iteration file I/O

  This separates concerns properly: dataset provides data availability, training controls data consumption.

● You're absolutely right about the validation batch construction issues. I need to implement the correct architecture  
   with fixed validation sets and proper separation of concerns. Let me fix this according to your specifications.      

  Plan: Fix Validation Batch Construction

  Issues to Fix:

  1. Missing eval_iters context - Dataset prep doesn't know how many samples training needs
  2. Wrong per-iteration loading - Should load validation set ONCE at training start
  3. Incorrect abstraction - Dataset should provide "buffet", training decides consumption

  Correct Architecture:

  1. Dataset Layer (data-specific)

  - Generates fixed pools of validation samples per stage
  - Configurable: VALIDATION_SAMPLES_PER_STAGE, SAMPLES_PER_FILE
  - No knowledge of training requirements

  2. Training Layer (training-specific)

  - Loads validation set ONCE at startup based on eval_iters
  - Decides how many samples to consume from available pool
  - Controls repetition/sampling strategy

  3. Key Files to Update:

  - data/shakespeare_char_diffusion/training_config.py - Add validation pool config
  - data/shakespeare_char_diffusion/prepare.py - Generate fixed validation pools
  - training_utils/dataset_interface.py - Add validation set loading
  - train_run.py - Load validation set once at startup
  - training_utils/model_evaluation.py - Use pre-loaded validation set
  - docs/refactoring_plan.md - Update validation architecture section

  4. Implementation Steps:

  1. Update dataset config with validation pool settings
  2. Modify prepare.py to generate validation pools (not per-iteration)
  3. Add validation set loader to dataset interface
  4. Update training script to load validation once
  5. Fix estimate_loss to use pre-loaded validation
  6. Update refactoring plan documentation

  This will achieve proper separation: dataset provides data availability, training controls data consumption.
