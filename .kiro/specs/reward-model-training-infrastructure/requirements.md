# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the training infrastructure for reward models used in GRPO (Generative Reward Policy Optimization). It provides tools for generating mixed natural/synthetic datasets, loading reward training data, and testing the reward model training pipeline. This infrastructure works with the dual-mode GPT architecture to enable adversarial training between generator and reward models.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher implementing GRPO, I want to generate training data that mixes natural and synthetic text, so that I can train a reward model to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reward training data THEN the system SHALL create sequences with random crossover points K between natural and synthetic text
2. WHEN a crossover point K is chosen THEN the system SHALL take the first K tokens from natural data and generate the remaining tokens using a base model
3. WHEN creating target labels THEN the system SHALL generate probability distributions [K/N, (N-K)/N] where N is the sequence length
4. WHEN processing data splits THEN the system SHALL maintain the same train/validation split as the base model to prevent data contamination

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want a command-line tool to prepare reward datasets, so that I can easily generate training data from any base model and text corpus.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the preparation script THEN the system SHALL accept parameters for model path, data path, output directory, and generation settings
2. WHEN loading a base model THEN the system SHALL set it to generator mode and evaluation state for consistent text generation
3. WHEN generating completions THEN the system SHALL support configurable temperature and top-k sampling parameters
4. WHEN saving datasets THEN the system SHALL output binary files with metadata for efficient loading during training

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want PyTorch dataset classes for reward model training, so that I can easily integrate reward data into standard training loops.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading reward datasets THEN the system SHALL provide a PyTorch Dataset class that handles binary data files
2. WHEN creating data loaders THEN the system SHALL support standard PyTorch DataLoader functionality with batching and shuffling
3. WHEN accessing dataset samples THEN the system SHALL return token sequences as LongTensor and probability targets as FloatTensor
4. WHEN querying dataset statistics THEN the system SHALL provide methods to analyze probability distributions and data quality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want configurable reward head architecture, so that I can experiment with different hidden layer sizes for the reward model.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the reward head THEN the system SHALL accept a reward_head_hidden_dim parameter in GPTConfig
2. WHEN no hidden dimension is specified THEN the system SHALL default to 256 units for backward compatibility
3. WHEN creating the reward head THEN the system SHALL use the configured hidden dimension for the MLP layer
4. WHEN initializing weights THEN the system SHALL properly initialize the configurable architecture

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing for the reward training infrastructure, so that I can verify data preparation and model functionality work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing data loading THEN the system SHALL verify binary file formats and metadata consistency
2. WHEN testing reward model forward passes THEN the system SHALL validate output shapes and probability distributions
3. WHEN testing dataset statistics THEN the system SHALL verify probability sums equal 1.0 and distributions are valid
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL provide clear success/failure feedback and diagnostic information
