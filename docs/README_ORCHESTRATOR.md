# Training Orchestrator Implementation - DDP-Safe

This document describes the implementation of the Dynamic Training Orchestrator for GPT model training, as specified in `docs/training_morfing_operations.md`. **This implementation is fully DDP-safe and supports multi-GPU distributed training.**

## Overview

The Training Orchestrator enables dynamic adjustment of training hyperparameters during training based on validation loss thresholds and timeout conditions. This implementation focuses on the main scaffolding and basic operations with full DDP compatibility.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Infrastructure
- **Dynamic State Parameters**: Multipliers and divisors for all configurable training parameters
- **Scaling Schedule**: YAML/JSON configuration loading for operation sequences
- **Main Training Loop Integration**: Automatic trigger checking and operation execution
- **Operation Execution Framework**: Master function handling all operation types
- **DDP-Safe Implementation**: Full multi-GPU distributed training support

### ✅ Basic Operations
- `change_lr`: Multiply learning rate by specified factor
- `change_batch_size`: Multiply batch size by specified factor  
- `change_grad_accum`: Multiply gradient accumulation steps by specified factor
- `reset_lr_schedule`: Reset learning rate warmup/decay schedule offset

### ✅ DDP Compatibility
- **State Synchronization**: All ranks maintain consistent state across operations
- **Broadcast Communication**: Master process decisions broadcasted to all ranks
- **Synchronized Execution**: All processes execute operations simultaneously
- **Clean Logging**: Only master process logs to prevent garbled output

### ✅ Testing & Validation
- Integration tests for configuration loading and validation
- Manual test simulation of orchestrator behavior
- DDP safety tests validating multi-rank state consistency
- Sample configuration files for different use cases

## DDP-Safe Architecture

### The Problem
The original implementation would break in multi-GPU DDP environments because only the master process (rank 0) would execute orchestrator operations, causing:
- **State Divergence**: Different learning rates, batch sizes across ranks
- **Schedule Desynchronization**: Different operation queues on each rank
- **Guaranteed Crashes**: Architectural changes on only one rank

### The Solution
Our DDP-safe implementation follows the pattern:
1. **Master Decides**: Rank 0 evaluates triggers and decides on operations
2. **Broadcast Decision**: Decision communicated to all ranks via `torch.distributed.broadcast_object_list`
3. **Synchronized Execution**: All ranks execute the same operation simultaneously

### Key Implementation Details
```python
# All processes participate in evaluation
if iter_num % eval_interval == 0:
    losses = estimate_loss()  # All ranks estimate
    
    # Master decides on operations
    op_to_run = [None]
    if master_process and scaling_schedule:
        # ... decision logic ...
        if triggered:
            op_to_run[0] = {'op': next_op, 'reason': reason, 'loss': val_loss}
    
    # Broadcast decision to all ranks
    if ddp:
        torch.distributed.broadcast_object_list(op_to_run, src=0)
    
    # All ranks execute synchronously
    if op_to_run[0] is not None:
        execute_operation(...)  # All ranks execute
        scaling_schedule.pop(0)  # All ranks update schedule
    
    # Synchronization barrier
    if ddp:
        torch.distributed.barrier()
```

## Usage

### 1. Configuration
Create a scaling schedule configuration file (YAML or JSON):

```yaml
# configs/my_schedule.yaml
- name: change_lr
  value: 2.0              # Double the learning rate
  trigger_loss: 6.0       # Trigger when val loss < 6.0
  max_wait_iters: 50000   # Or after 50k iterations
  reevaluate: false       # Don't re-evaluate loss immediately
```

### 2. Training Script Usage
Set the scaling schedule file in your training configuration:

```bash
# Single GPU
python train.py --scaling_schedule_file=configs/my_schedule.yaml

# Multi-GPU DDP (4 GPUs)
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 train.py --scaling_schedule_file=configs/my_schedule.yaml
```

### 3. Monitoring
The orchestrator will log operation executions (only on master process):

```
=== SCALING OPERATION TRIGGERED (DDP SYNC) ===
Operation: change_lr
Trigger reason: Loss threshold
Current val loss: 5.8, Trigger loss: 6.0
Learning rate multiplier updated to: 2.0
=== SCALING OPERATION COMPLETE ===
```

## Testing

### Run DDP Safety Tests
```bash
python test_ddp_safety.py
```

### Run Manual Simulation
```bash
python test_manual.py
```

## Configuration Files

### Sample Configurations
- `configs/sample_scaling_schedule.yaml`: Production example with realistic thresholds
- `configs/sample_scaling_schedule.json`: Same schedule in JSON format
- `configs/test_scaling_schedule.yaml`: Quick-trigger configuration for testing

## Implementation Files

### Core Implementation
- `train.py`: Main orchestrator integration with DDP safety
- `logger.py`: Enhanced logging with operation tracking
- `configs/`: Configuration files directory

### Documentation
- `README_ORCHESTRATOR.md`: This documentation

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE**: Main scaffolding, basic operations, and DDP safety implemented and tested
✅ **DDP-SAFE**: Fully compatible with multi-GPU distributed training
⏳ **PENDING**: Advanced architectural operations (Section 5 & 6 of specification)

The implementation is production-ready for basic hyperparameter scaling operations in both single-GPU and multi-GPU DDP environments.
